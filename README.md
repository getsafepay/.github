# Safepay public templates

This repository contains templates for Pull Requests and Issues that will be adopted across the organization.

## Issue Templates

Issue templates are contained in the folder `ISSUE_TEAMPLATE` and are to be used by Product Managers when creating new issues for feature requests of bugfixes.

## Pull Request Templates

Pull request templates are contained in the folder `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` and are to be used by engineers when contributing code to respond to an issue. There are two templates for Pull Requests

1. `detailed_pull_request_template.md`: This template is meant to be used for big features, high priority bugfixes that may have multiple touch points or breaking changes that affect multiple repositories and/or packages
2. `simple_pull_request_template.md`: This template is meant to be used for slightly less critical features, bugfixes or breaking changes. It is meant to be more free flowing giving the developer more flexibility to describe the change to be introduced.
